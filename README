Library for TI's DM365 SoC Codecs by RidgeRun

This library builds a autotools (and Linux in general) friendly version of the
codecs for the dm36x SoC family. This greatly simplifies the process of building
apps that require from APIs related to CodecEngine.

This library is used by RidgeRun's gst-ti-plugins to allow the plugins to be
independent of the version of DVSDK being used.

To build all you need to do is to pass the following arguments:
  --with-dvsdkdir to configure the location of the dvsdk directory

This library always target the latest DVSDK, for older DVSDK releases see the
corresponding branch.
